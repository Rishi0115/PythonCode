# Heart Disease Prediction using Linear Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project to predict heart disease using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The model used for this project is a Linear Regression model, with scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and train_test_split to build, evaluate, and visualize the predictions.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle. It contains information about various health-related attributes of patients, which are used to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease.
# Notes
i)   The dataset has been preprocessed to remove any missing or invalid data.
ii)  Linear Regression is typically not the ideal model for classification problems like predicting heart disease, but it is used here for simplicity.
iii) You can experiment with other models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to improve the performance.
