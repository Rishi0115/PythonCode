1)Loan Approval Prediction
This project predicts the approval status of a loan application using machine learning, based on applicant attributes such as income, credit score, loan amount, and more. The model is built with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and other essential data processing tools to help financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals.
# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project can be found in the /data folder, or it can be downloaded from [source link if applicable]. It contains historical data about loan applicants and their approval status.
# Contributions:
Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, and submit pull requests.
# Notes:
i) The dataset has been preprocessed to remove any missing or invalid data, ensuring a cleaner input for the model.
ii) Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for this classification problem, but you can experiment with other models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to compare performance.
iii) While SVM is a powerful model for classification, fine-tuning hyperparameters like the kernel type and regularization parameter can further enhance its performance.
iv) The dataset may require feature scaling for optimal SVM performance, and that has been taken into account during preprocessing.
v) Visualizations using Seaborn are provided to help identify key relationships between the features and the target variable, which can be useful for feature engineering.
